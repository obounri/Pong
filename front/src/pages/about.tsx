                Pong is one of the first computer games that ever created, this
                simple &quot;tennis like&quot; game features two paddles and a
                ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one
                to gain10 point, a player gets a point once the opponent misses
                a ball. The game can be played with two human players, or one
                player against a computer controlled paddle. The game was
                originally developed by Allan Alcorn and released in 1972 by
                Atari corporations. Soon, Pong became a huge success, and became
                the first commercially successful game, on 1975, Atari release a
                home edition of Pong (the first version was played on Arcade
                machines) which sold 150,000 units. Today, the Pong Game is
                considered to be the game which started the video games
                industry, as it proved that the video games market can produce
                significant revenues.

                Nolan Bushnell founded Atari at 1972 in order to create games
                and ideas and license them to other companies for mass
                production. Pong was actually a training exercise for one of
                Atari's employees - Allan Alcorn, once it was finished, Nolan
                made few adjustments in order to make the game more interesting
                (like changing the ball's return angle) and added simple sound
                effects. The first Pong Arcade machine was installed on a local
                bar, and it was so successful that Atari decided to produce and
                sell the game by themselves, rather then licensing it to other
                companies. In 1973 the company finally got a line of credit from
                Wells Fargo and started an assembly line, by the end of the
                year, Pong arcade machines were shipped to location all over the
                U.S. as well as to other countries. Similar to other famous
                games such as Pacman and Tetris, Pong became one of the symbols
                of computer gaming.

                Atari sold more then 35000 Pong machines, this figure is only
                about one third of the total number of Pong machines that were
                sold globally, since many Pong clones appeared shortly after the
                debut of the original Atari Pong game. The way Atari chose to
                compete with the Pong Game clones was to produce more innovative
                games such as "Double Pong" which was a pong game with four
                players, two in every side and a bigger screen.
